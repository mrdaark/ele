<p class="curly">Find what you love to do, find the joy in it, and express yourself through your passion (Barry Williams)</p>

Thank you for stopping by my Online English Class website. I am a professional English teacher and work at Pskov State University. I have a deep love and devotion to this amazing language and I am eager to practice and learn more about it every day. I do want to spread that knowledge to everyone who loves English (or needs it) as much as I do. I am convinced that if you do something with love it makes the process really enjoyable and helps you succeed.

Take a look around and explore my Online English Class. I hope you will enjoy the context of the site and will find it as enjoyable as useful. I am just beginning my site so I am still filling its context. Subscribe if you feel like it and contact me if you have any questions, or would like to see something more here.
